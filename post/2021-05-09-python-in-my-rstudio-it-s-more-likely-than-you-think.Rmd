Have you ever thought to yourself, "sure, R is great, but what I *really* need is a way to make my life more complicated by adding Python into the mix"? Sure you have! Luckily for you, there's an R package that lets you run Python right in RStudio and even have the two programming languages "talk" to each other. Enter: `reticulate`!

First, let's load up `reticulate` by creating an R code block and running the `library` function. We'll then create an object called `species` and assign it the common name of the reticulated python, which is the world's longest snake and also the namesake of this package!

```{r}
# R

library(reticulate)

species <- "Reticulated python"
```

Next, let's make a Python code block where we define `species` as the reticulated python's scientific name.

```{python}
# Python

species = "Malayopython reticulatus"
```

Now for the fun (?) part: combining R and Python in a single output! In an R code block, we can use `py$` to pull up things defined in Python.

```{r}
# R

cat(c(species, py$species))
```

Wondering if this works the other way around? It sure does! If we want to access something defined in R but we're in a Python code block, we can use `r.` in front of the object's name.

```{python}
# Python

print(species, r.species)
```

There you have it--a super simple demo showing you how to use Python and R together in RStudio. Hope this helped (or at least taught you a cool fact about reticulated pythons)!
